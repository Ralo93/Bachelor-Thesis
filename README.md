## General info
This project includes all files associated with my bachelor thesis, which include the PDF version of my thesis, the implemented and altered code and an introduction to the ALEVIN environment. <p>
Interested in genetic algorithms or a starting point to explore the internet of tomorrow? <br>
Reading the first chapter of the Thesis.pdf above should do the trick! <p>

## Sources
The project I supported can be found at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/alevin/ from where I used v2.2. <br>

## Get started
I have extracted the developer documentation from the ALEVIN2 project for you as well as their official README in exREADME above. Their README includes all necessary information about requirements, installation, running ALEVIN, features and their basic directory structure. <br>

### Technologies <br>
Technologies I personally have used are Java, JUnit, Gradle and Eclipse. For all the technologies involved check the exREADME.md.

## Project status <br>
Wrap up.
## Exclaimer <br>
I felt like saying that my actual code is very messy. This was the first major open source project I tried to support with very little programming knowledge. While managing to get the GUI actually running my algorithm (after a challenging installation procedure for newcomers) and getting my expected results after partly minutes of runtime, I no longer had the strength to refactor anything. <p>
So be prepared looking at my code, I remember affectionately calling it "the battlefield".
